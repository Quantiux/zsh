# zsh config

This repo contains my configuration files for [zsh](https://www.zsh.org/). I use two plugins, [autosuggestions](https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-autosuggestions) and [syntax highlighting](https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-syntax-highlighting), and my [starship config](https://github.com/Quantiux/starship) as prompt. Exra config settings are in `shellconfig` folder and sourced in `.zshrc` (stole [Brodie's idea](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w77PJ_HU1zI)).
